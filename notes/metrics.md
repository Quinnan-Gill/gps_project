Two 2 LSTM cells to increase capacity

1. Start evaluating how many positive cases that are wrong and how many negative cases that are wrong

Google Keyword spotting neural network

Window size and step size

2. Extend data_analysis for stdev and other information

3. Look into any sensor changes / test how cache impl could be affecting it now

4. Plot the magnitude of everything to see if it is garbage in vs garbage out to see if there are any jumps in magnitude
cleaning step that we did not capture being

X.Y.Z of gps and leo and plot so it looks like a wave form
all should be a ciclical pattern (sin wave) with natural frequence of 90 minutes (noisier)

timestamp as the x-axis and y-axis is L1 and L2 (focus on those)

Reach out to Xinyi about the RNN and normalizing across all data and how it trains (final prediction)

Find an example and try it out, see how the entire flow is working

Ending sentence no likely match possibly orbital location (logitude point)
