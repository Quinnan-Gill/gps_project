Find a way to encode it 
* normalize the data
* Process the data to check the window size and see how large
*

spectrogram
turn 1d to multiple (picture, make sure it is larger than a bubble)

IOU = intersection over union

Normallize by expected value (x, y, z for gps ~ 20,000 + radius of earth ,, or min/max)
bigger window (~20/32 day squence, more is better)

L1 and L2 (vary and not drematic min/max)
